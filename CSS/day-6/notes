1: Position


<!-- Static -->

when we use Static position 
As we know by default position  is static os in ststic position its postion doesnot change even if we chnage 



<!-- Relative -->

in relative position position of container is changes with respect to its original position 
if we use top 10px them it down 10px from its original position 
* relative position apna space(original  ) nhi chorta hai after modification  uska original space uske liye hu reserve rhega 




<!-- Absolute -->

*in absolute position its chnaged its position with respect to its parents position position 
if its parents doents have any position then it chnages its position with respect to its grand parents position 

*if its parents and grandparents have does not any parents then it chnage its p[osition ] with respect to viewpoint 
*in absolute position it free its original space for othes 




<!-- Fixed -->
* when we use fixed position then its position is chnages with respect to viewpot 
* In fixed position container does not change its position even we scrool the page 
* in fixed position it leave its position for othres after modification 
* In coder  army web site the header section is still view when we schroll our page down in my portfolio or about dsa page 
position
position: fixed;
    top: 0px;
    left: 0px;
    right: 0px;





<!-- Sticky -->
Stickey position is like fixed but is stick only in his parents 
whereas in fixed positinn container is fixed in entire page 





<!-- 2: Z-index -->
* ye wahi pe kam kreag jha pe position use ho 
* static  wale pe kam nhi krega 
* it is use when two box are overlap and whuch box we want to see 
* it follw stack apporch on the basis of z-index 
* That box whose value of z-index higher its show first then the second highest box show  
* for all box by  default z-index is auto  








<!-- 3: OverFlow: hidden, visible, scroll, auto -->

* By default the overflow is visible in this extra overflow part show outside the container 
  
  <!-- overflow:visible  -->
  in  visible  overflow extra  part show outside the container 


 <!-- overflow:hidden  -->
In this overflow extra content is hidden from the container 


<!-- overflow:scroll -->
in this overflow we get a scrool with the help of whuch we can see the whole content in the same caontainer 


<!-- overflow:auto -->
in this over flow if the the content is larger than the container the we get a scroll as scroll overflow 
and is the contenet is is fit in container then we show full content 


<!-- 4: float  and clear -->

<!-- float -->
 it use for shift the content left side or right side 
 like 
 float:left;
 float:right;


 <!-- clear -->
 if we use clear:left and a img is already float left then the second img is place  at down of first img  
 and 
 if we use clear :right and a img a already right then it place down 

 when we use clear:both then if there is a  float img  in left or  right then the image is place at down
